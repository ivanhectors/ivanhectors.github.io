      I am currently studying at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://ukdw.ac.id/" target="_blank">Duta Wacana Christian University</a>. I recently completed my awesome three-month internship at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://softwareseni.co.id/" target="_blank">SoftwareSeni Indonesia</a> as Quality Assurance Intern. I'm also working part-time at 
      <a class="underline-link" href="http://oia.ukdw.ac.id" target="_blank">Office of International Affairs, UKDW</a> as student buddy, reporter and a <strong>LOT</strong> fun things to do.

      As a full-stack developer, I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my keen eye for design to create a beautiful product. My goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient under the hood while providing engaging, pixel-perfect user experiences.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably reading romcom novels, watching movies and TV shows, 
      or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
